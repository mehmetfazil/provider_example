A quick and dirty explanation of flutter provider package, in 4 steps

## Overview

Provider is a great state management tool, but for starters it is a pain to grasp terms like Provider.of, ChangeNotifier, Consumer etc. Even, what does even provider provides?

So just open *lib/main.dart* and read the comments. Hopefully it will bridge the gap between theory and implementation of provider!
